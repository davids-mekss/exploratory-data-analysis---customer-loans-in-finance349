You should do Milestone 3 in its entirety, but for Milestone 4 the df should not have any skew
transformations since it will lead to inaccurate reporting or columns dropped due to collinearity
as you may drop a column related to the analysis. 

The dataframe for Milestone 4 should have all columns casted to their datatypes,
and all nulls handled (including dropping those columns over 50% nulls) but nothing else as we are
trying to query and analyise the data so need it in the untransformed format.
An example is in the Finance dataset if you skew transform the cols then the total_amount column wont have
the actual amount for the loan but a reduced, transformed amount which is not the actual data. 

In short Milestone 3 was to show that you can do all these preparation steps that may be expected of you
in a job which included the skew transforms and collinearity dropping cols for ML models, but Milestone 4
is an analysis of the data so doesn't need those exact steps. 

You can make a copy of the df after handing the nulls using df.copy() which you can use for Milestone 4
or you can load in the raw df and do those specific cleaning steps again to it its up to you!

In milestone 4 it be useful to know which columns you need to use to calculate loss (for non financial )

I wont give away clear answers ðŸ˜‚
but you will need the !!!funded_amount_inv!!! and !!!funded_amount!!!  cols for Milestone 4
which is why you cant drop one of them due to collinearity
